Third party merchants offer the goods&amp; services.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Service provides you with a method of discovering offers from independent third party merchants. These Merchants sell their respective Products subject to their own terms and conditions.  For example:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Airtime: If you choose to purchase pre-paid airtime, you do so pursuant to the relevant terms and conditions of your mobile telecommunications provider.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Utilities: If you choose to purchase utility services, you do so pursuant to the relevant terms and conditions of your mobile utility provider.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Food: If you choose to purchase food delivery services, you agreed to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of Tufu delivery services.</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Payments are processed by third parties.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to facilitate your purchases from Merchants, Tufu has integrated its Service with the billing solutions of certain mobile money providers and credit card issuing banks (“Payment Processors”). If you purchase a Product from a Merchant using your supported mobile money wallet or account or credit card, payments will be processed by such Payment Processors. Payment Processors have their own terms and conditions governing your use of their payment services. You understand and agree that Tufu does not process payments and is not responsible or liable for any transactions in which you engage. By engaging in a purchase transaction using your mobile money account or credit card, you authorize the Merchant (or Tufu on its behalf) to bill your account or card for the purchase amount.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Your privacy is important to us. 
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tufu takes the matters of protection and security of its users’ information very seriously. Tufu’s privacy policy governing the Service is attached to these Terms (“Privacy Policy”). The Privacy Policy is incorporated into these Terms by this reference. By using the Service, you agree to the use of your data in accordance with Tufu’s Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy addresses only the information collected by Tufu in providing the Service to you. Merchants and Payment Processors have their own information gathering practices that will apply when you choose to purchase Products.

</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you have any questions, concerns or requests related to a Product you have purchased from a Merchant, you should contact the Merchant directly or contact us at tufuservices@gmail.com. Each Merchant maintains its own customer contact desk for handling such requests, however Tufu may do its best effort to assist you. If you wish to submit a complaint about the practices of a Merchant offering its Products via the Service, you may contact us by email tufuservices@gmail.com
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">

</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; 11. The Service is provided without any warranties or guarantees. 
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. Tufu AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Any matters arising concerning the interpretation, validity or implementation of this Agreement not solved by mutual agreement between the Parties shall be submitted to arbitration in the English language before a sole arbitrator to take place. The arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators of the United Kingdom. The arbitral decision shall be final and binding on the Parties and may be made an order of court. The Parties unconditionally consent and submit to the jurisdiction of the High Court for such purpose. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed as preventing Tufu from seeking injunctive relief (or any other provisional remedy) from any court having jurisdiction over the Parties and the subject matter of the dispute as is necessary to protect Tufu’s name, proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, or any other intellectual property rights.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">
